# Heracles

> a simple 2D Graphic Physics Engine based on OpenGL 3.3

Simple Physics Engine for simulating motion of convex polygon with adjustable paraments, such as gravitational acceleration, elastic collision coefficient, mass, size and friction coefficient. Use it for simple 2D game making, for education, or just for fun, for instance, use Genetic Algorithm to make a snake learn how to move.

## Demos

You can press F1~F6 to load 6 different demos, for example:

A demo of pyramid (Demo1, with GUI), you can create another brick with large mass to strike it :)

And a demo of simplified version of *Angry Birds* (Demo4, without GUI)

## Functions

* Create customized rigid body with different type, size and mass
* Drag or apply impulse on selected body
* Set world paraments such as such as gravitational acceleration and elastic collision coefficient
* Modify the attribute of selected body, such as mass and friction coefficient
* Toggle GUI, which will toggle showing text and collision contact point
* Set the world to pause or resume

## Usage

* You can see it at its top-right corner
